# K.O.
A small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) based on [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024) and  [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (both clones).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](https://hjondi.github.io/K.O/)

That screenshot is fake, by the way. I never reached 2048 :smile:
